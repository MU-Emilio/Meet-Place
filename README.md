**Scenery**

Alejandra is in finals, so she is struggling a lot with keeping her tasks and meetings organized. Yesterday, she forgot her academic advice appointment with her teacher, it all happened because she had so many things to do, she didn't notice that the appointment was coming. Her teacher recommended she keep her meetings organized in a notebook, but Alejandra does not like carrying so many things with her. Speaking with her best friend, Laura, about that situation, Laura told her about a new website that has been helping people to keep more organized, not only in professional life, but personal too. She told her about ¨MeetPlace¨, and showed her that all of their friends from school were already registered and planning events on the web. Alejandra was so amazed that she ran to the first place she saw, so she could register in a very easy way to the platform and keep her events and her friend´s events synchronized with her Google calendar.
